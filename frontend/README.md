# CORES
. cross origin resource sharing
. it provides safty to the   application

.cross origin means
   a. if url is diffrent then it is cross origin
   b. if port number if different then it is cross origin

# how to manage it?

:- url or port should be whitelisted on the backend

but here it is used only when it is on localhost

# suppose when application is running on netfly the in could be on different port or url

# how could it be solved?
